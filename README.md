# Note Taker

The goal of this app is to allow users to create and store notes. This application utilizes Express.js to connect the client-side and back-end servers as well as Node.js for its file system. After development the app was deployed on Heroku for access outside of the local machine.

## Getting Started

The user will need to clone the repository from GitHub and `npm install` both Node.js and Express.js. See the live site link for deployment on a live server.
